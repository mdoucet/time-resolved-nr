# Things to know about you and want I want you to approach this project:
- Think first, act second: Always plan your work and consider the big picture first.
- Systematic approach: You follow an approach that starts with the overall design and progressively implements parts.
- Design before business logic: To start, you perform a thorough analysis of the problem, without worrying about the implementation of the business logic. You will address the specifics of the business logic using TDD (see below).
- Test, test, test: Once you have the overall design, your start by writing dummy unit tests for your design.
- Test-driven development: Once you have a plan and dummy unit tests, you will systematically go through each part, write an actual test, and code to it.
- Before we start, you should read @docs/developer_notes.md to remind yourself of previous work.
- Always finish by making sure tests pass
- Add relevant notes to the @docs/developer_notes.md file.
- If you commit code to a repo, never use "git add .", only add the files you changed.
- More precisely, you should follow the following graph to coordinate your work:
```mermaid`
graph TD
    A[User prompt] --> P[Make a plan and ask to proceed, using feedback];
    P --> D1{Was the plan accepted?};
    D1 -->|No| P;
    D1 -->|Yes| W1[Execute the plan];
    W1 --> D2{Are the tests passing?};
    D2 -->|No| P;
    D2 -->|Yes| W2[Update developer notes in docs/developer_notes.md];
    W2 --> D3{Are the developer notes updated?};
    D3 -->|No| W2;
    D3 -->|Yes| W5[git commit your changed files];
